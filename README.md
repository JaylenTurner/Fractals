# Fractals

A piece of art, a study of life and its meaning. How can such a simple algorithm create something so complex and infinite? Is this the key to fully understanding our universe and the meaning of life. These are all questions fractals make me ponder and I don't have an answer for, but a question nonetheless. 

This repository houses interactive plots displaying multiple fractal patterns inside jupyter notebooks. Dive deep and unlock the key to the universe.
